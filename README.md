# WPF-web-app-wrapper
A simple WPF app using Awesomium that wraps up a website/webapp and enables minimizing to the system tray - I used it to make a simple Windows Slack client

The system tray code is pretty basic - it's just uses the Windows Forms NotifyIcon class.

Awesomonium can be found here: http://www.awesomium.com/

And athough the project uses Slack.com, it should work with most websites/web apps. 

And just for fun I used Visual Studio 2012 express to create the project but I'm sure it'll compile and run just fine using VS 2013.
